## Problem
Students track deadlines across multiple portals (Canvas, Gradescope, Piazza, etc.). Switching tabs and manually consolidating causes missed work and constant anxiety.

## Solution — OneLook
A compact widget that shows all upcoming deadlines in one place. Students can add items manually (or paste a quick CSV), filter by source, and sort by urgency. Each item surfaces “days left,” due time, and a direct link.

## Why it helps
Students save time, reduce context switching, and avoid surprises. The widget fits on a laptop sidebar and focuses on clarity: “What’s due next?”

## Scope
Prototype uses local storage + mock data (no auth/API). Focus is UX clarity and production intuition: empty-state guidance, sensible defaults, quick add, and urgency colors.

## Future Work

- Lightweight integrations (Canvas/Gradescope token flow)
- .ics export, calendar sync, reminders
- Team/peer sharing for group assignments
